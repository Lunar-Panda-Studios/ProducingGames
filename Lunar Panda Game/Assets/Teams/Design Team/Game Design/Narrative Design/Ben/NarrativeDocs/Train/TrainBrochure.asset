    been awarded the Safest Travelling Commuters award for 3 years straight! So be
    assured, we know what we are doing.\n\nYou are currently riding on our newest

    our safest train model yet. \n\nIt's so safe, that we've only tested this mode
    2 times before giving it the all-clear for commercial use!\n\nIsn't that amazing!"

  docText: "Yesterday morning, around 9 am 2 trains collided together killing all
    passengers aboard. Police have shut down the train lines with no notice on how
    long they will be closed. The wreckage has caused severe damage to a nearby train
    station. Fortunately, there were no deaths reported for those waiting on the
    station's platform. \r\n\r\nPolice are currently looking into what could be the
    cause of the fatal collision and they are trying to track down any leads.\r\n\r\nOne
    of our reporters was able to interview one of the commuters who had been standing
    on the platform: \u201CThe train came out of nowhere, I was able to see that
    they were going to hit and forced as many people back as possible. I wasn\u2019t
    able to see what caused it since I was more focused on other people.\u201D\r\n\r\nWe
    send our condolences to the family and friends of the victims in these hard times.\r\n"

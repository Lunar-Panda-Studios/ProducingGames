:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project and its packages These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Packages

At present this is not a very large project and thus the codebase is limited to a single repository, please bare in mind that changes which aren't useful to all users should be isolated to a seperate package which includes this one as a dependency.

### Design Decisions

The main design principal here is that there is a seperateion between the material library interface presented and the underlying API calls and translation layers which do the heavy lifting, utilites which might be useful to other importers should be broken out so that they can be reused. Additional importers should have their own namespace.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for  this project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the required template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one, if it is closed then link to the existing issue in your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for  this project, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please perform a cursory search to see if the suggestion has already been made, comment instead of posting a copy (or link if its closed when you create your suggestion). When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of  this project which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most  this project users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](# this project-and-packages).
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of  this project you're using.** You can get the exact version by running ` this project -v` in your terminal, or by starting  this project and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/ this project/command-palette).
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to  this project? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using  this project or developing packages in  this project, the [ this project Flight Manual](https://flight-manual. this project.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [ this project/flight-manual. this project.io](https://github.com/ this project/flight-manual. this project.io).

#### Local development

The best approach is to clone this repository and include as a local package into a new unity project. 

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain  this project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible  this project
- Enable a sustainable system for  this project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
